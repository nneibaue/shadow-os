# Clarifying Questions for Wendell## Relations (edges) - Typed Connections
14. **Required edge types**: Which relations are essential from day one (*supports*, *contradicts*, *refines*, *is-part-of*, *see-also*)? Any others?  
15. **Evidence & rationale**: Do you want short rationales or citations attached to edges? Should contradictions always include a rationale?  
16. **Outline as subgraph**: Should book outlines be expressed strictly via *is-part-of* edges, or do you prefer a separate "Outline" structure that references Bars?
17. **Contradiction handling**: Since contradictions create "creative tension," how should the system present competing Bars in drafts?

## Process & ergonomics - Speed-of-Thought Capture
18. **Capture ritual**: What's your ideal "that's a Bar" ritual in practice (voice note, one-line text, highlight-to-Bar)?  
19. **Latency tolerance**: What's the max acceptable delay from capture → durable Bar? (This is described as "a very important metric")
20. **Editing boundaries**: Bars are immutable; expansions are editable. Is that correct? Any exceptions?
21. **Context preservation**: When a Bar emerges from dialogue, how much conversational context should be preserved?

## Drafting & pedagogy - The "Mech Suit" in Action
22. **Citation style**: How should Bars appear within prose (inline tokens, footnotes, endnotes)?  
23. **Modes**: Which drafting modes matter first (aphoristic "tight," didactic "explainer," narrative case study)?  
24. **Exercises**: Do you want the system to scaffold exercises/prompts tied to Bars?
25. **Book generation**: What does "produce a book at any moment's notice" look like in practice? Full automation or guided curation?

## Configuration & Control - "Tweaking the Knobs"
26. **YAML accessibility**: What level of technical complexity is acceptable in config files? Should there be a UI for common tweaks?
27. **Expansion tuning**: Beyond 10/100/500 words, what other expansion parameters matter (style, formality, audience)?
28. **Retrieval policies**: How do you want to balance semantic search vs. tag-based vs. graph traversal for different use cases?

## Team & permissions
29. **Contributors**: Will others mint Bars? Should we model authorship and review status?  
30. **Privacy**: Any Bars/expansions that should be private or redacted in public drafts?  
31. **Licensing**: How do you want to license Bars and the resulting content?

## Multi-modal capture & workflow  
32. **Voice capture**: Should the system support voice-to-Bar workflows for capturing insights during walks, conversations, or meditation?
33. **Context-aware capture**: When highlighting text from books/articles, should it auto-suggest related Bars or potential contradictions?
34. **Batch processing**: Do you envision importing existing writings/notes to seed the initial Bar collection?
35. **Mobile accessibility**: What's the minimum viable mobile interface for capture and browsing?

## Advanced relationship dynamics  
36. **Temporal relationships**: Should some edges have time-based properties (e.g., "this Bar evolved from that Bar")?
37. **Strength weighting**: Should relationships have confidence scores or strength indicators?
38. **Contradiction resolution**: When Bars contradict, do you want structured dialectical processes for exploring the tension?
39. **Emergence detection**: Should the system flag when new patterns or meta-Bars might be emerging from clusters?

## Evaluation & correctness
40. **Quality thresholds**: What signals indicate a Bar/edge/expansion is "good enough" (clarity, usefulness, non-triviality)?  
41. **Contradiction policy**: Is it desirable to keep deliberate contradictions as creative tension? How should these surface in drafts?
42. **Grammar integrity**: How do we ensure the emerging "grammar of ontology" remains coherent as it scales?to refine Nate's understanding) (v2025-08-26)

## Core Vision & Shadow Work Context
1. **Shadow work integration**: How does the Bars system specifically support shadow work practices? Are there particular Bar categories or relations that map to shadow work concepts?
2. **Coaching methodology**: When you say "teach people how to coach people to coach," what specific skills or capacities are you developing? How do Bars function as teaching tools in this process?
3. **Mythopoetic dimension**: What makes this ontolingua "mythopoetic" specifically? How do story, archetype, and meaning-making factor into the Bar system?

## Integral Theory & Development Lines
4. **Quadrant mapping**: How should Bars map into the integral grid (inside/outside × one/many)? Should each Bar declare a quadrant by default, or is this optional metadata?
5. **Development lines**: Do Bars or practices map to specific development lines/stages? How does your "higher development line" inform the system design?
6. **Perspective-taking**: How do you want the system to handle Bars that might be valid from one developmental perspective but not another?

## Scope & Vision  
7. **Primary outcome**: Is the first milestone a single book, multiple books, or a living curriculum? What *must* the first book accomplish?  
8. **Audience & voice**: Who is the first book for (self-practitioners, coaches, teams)? What voice registers are "in-bounds" (clinical, poetic, mythic)?

## Bars (atoms) - Core Mechanics
9. **Bar genesis**: Beyond "that's a Bar" moments in dialogue, are there other valid sources? Can solo reflection produce Bars, or do they require interpersonal validation?
10. **Definition test**: What makes a phrase "Bar-worthy"? Are there litmus tests or heuristics for minting a Bar?  
11. **Granularity**: Do Bars vary in abstraction (axioms vs. tactics)? If yes, should we tag the "level" of each Bar?  
12. **Expansions**: Are 10/100/500-word expansions the right defaults? Any other canonical forms (story, dialogue, exercise, counter-example)?
13. **Memetic quality**: What distinguishes a good meme (Bar) from just a memorable phrase? How do we preserve the "memetic loot" quality?rifying Questions for Wendell (to refine Nate’s understanding) (v2025-08-26)
