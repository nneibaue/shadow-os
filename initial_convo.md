I need your help designing an agentic system to help my friend Wendell on a project that he's working on. Are you ready to do this? Before we begin, I need you to do some deep research on the internet to find the latest and greatest on what people are doing with RAG, R-A-G, and what people are doing with Pydantic AI, and what kind of agentic system architectures people are finding success with. For context, this project that we're going to do is building a system to help an author write a book and organize all of his ideas. Maybe we write a couple of books. If the information is organized in such a way that AI, an agent, can produce a book from that information at any moment's notice.

## Assistant
Absolutely—ready to roll. I did a fresh sweep of the “latest & greatest” across RAG, Pydantic AI, and agentic architectures. Here’s a tight synthesis plus a starter blueprint for Wendell’s “Author OS.”

This is great. I took a skim. I'll read a little bit more in depth later on. So let me give you some other constraints that I'm working with. I will be building the code, and I can build any software. I'm pretty good. You should know this by now. Wendel is one of the smartest, if not the smartest person I've ever met. He's not a software engineer, but could learn whatever he needs to, to work on this tool. So not only do I want this tool to be a tool for him to use, but ideally, I build it and we build it in such a way that he can go and tweak the knobs of the tool as he sees fit. So we're going to ultimately want some config files at the front that can configure some of these knobs. Keep that in mind as we're working. Don't give me any output right now. Just confirm that you've understood what I've said.

## Assistant
Got it. I understand: you’ll be building the system yourself, Wendell’s extremely sharp but not a software engineer, and the design goal is that he can directly tweak/configure the system through front-facing config files rather than digging into code. I’ll keep that constraint in mind as we move forward.

## User
Alright, here's some other information. We want things to be extremely ergonomic. See, I love the engineering outline you gave me, how to store all the data, the various agents that we need to build. And also, we need to keep in mind that this thing has to be usable. Like, getting ideas saved and codified, and rhetoric written and iterated on, at the speed of thought, is kind of the core operating principle we want to have guide us. Because the only useful, novel information comes from us humans, and in this case, specifically Wendell, coming up with this information. And if there's too much latency between the thought coming into the brain and rhetoric being written down somewhere, it's a very important metric. So I know we can do the back-end on all of that, but the interface... Like, no one has time to be a front-end developer on this project. So I really like your idea with Panel and FastAPI. I think that's how I want to build the interface. And I can use Copilot to help build all of that. So long as we have the right system prompts for Copilot, specifically I like using Clod Sonnet, and we can have prompt files for Copilot, and we can have even MCP servers for Copilot. And I'm using VS Code. So something we're going to have to balance is, like, using the tooling available to us in VS Code to do the work against building agents that do the work. Like, I would probably imagine that I use the VS Code built-in agentic tooling to help build this particular framework and interface so that this can come to fruition.

## Assistant
Heard. Ergonomics + “speed-of-thought” capture, minimal front-end lift, Panel+FastAPI UI, config-driven knobs Wendell can tweak, and leaning on VS Code + Copilot/MCP to build and operate. I’ll bake those constraints into the design.

If you want, I can now propose:
- a minimal **Panel + FastAPI** scaffold (typed, Pydantic v2),
- a **config schema** Wendell can edit (YAML),
- the **capture loop** for near-zero-latency input (hotkeys, autosave, streaming RAG),
- and starter **Copilot prompt files + an MCP server outline** to accelerate dev.

Say the word and I’ll drop the whole blueprint with code stubs and prompt files.

## User
We'll get there. I want to give you a little context about the project itself. So, there's a lot of this that I don't... I won't be able to eloquently speak near close to what Wendell might give you. He does something called shadow work, which I believe is under the domain of coaching, broadly speaking. He has this game he's been developing over a while called Bars. Now, a bar is a meme. Physically, these manifest as little white cards about the size of playing cards with a phrase on them. So, a meme. The way I see it, it's operationally similar to what an idiom or a colloquialism kind of does for us. One of the first bars that I heard about when I first went over there is Bars as Memetic Loot. M-E-M-E-T-I-C. Memetic Loot. So, part of this system... So, the basic idea here is that, as far as I understand it enough after talking to Wendell and trying to describe it to you, is that a set of bars forms a grammar of ontology as a general concept. And that makes sense. If you distill the particular dialect of English language within a small group of people, you could probably distill it into the sets of bars. I don't know how many bars there are, but this is the basis vector for the particular ontology that that particular group shares. Now, given that, what Wendell is trying to do is teach people how to be helpful assistants. A coach people to coach. And the mechanic and the language behind all this is that this book that they read introduces them to what he calls a mythopoetic ontolingua. So, it's a set of... It's a language. It's a language framework deal. And I'm butchering the hell out of this, more likely than not. But that's the basic idea. And as this book is being developed, bars are being synthesized all the time. Bars are like the little pieces of ontology that you can save. They're memes. And ultimately in this system, a component of this is going to be a rag that can search bars. Now, I have a particular idea that you could store the 10-word version of a bar, the 100-word version of a bar, the 500-word version of a bar. You could pick that. That's a knob that you can tweak. And AI can help fill in from a basic outline what that information is. Are you following so far? Let me know what you understand, and then ask me two clarifying questions.

## Assistant
I’m with you.

Here’s what I understand: Wendell’s “Bars” are compact memes—short textual units printed on cards—that collectively form a shared grammar of meaning for a group (a mythopoetic ontolingua). The project aims to (a) capture/synthesize new Bars continuously, (b) organize them so they become the basis vectors of the ontology, and (c) let an agent draft book sections from that corpus on demand. A key UX knob is per-Bar expansion length (e.g., 10/100/500 words) so each Bar can exist as a canonical seed plus AI-assisted elaborations. The system will need RAG over Bars (and their expansions) to search, relate, and cite them during drafting.

Two clarifying questions:
1) **Canonicality & evolution:** When a Bar evolves (wording tweaks, better phrasing), do you want strict versioning with a single “current canonical” per Bar, or are multiple variants allowed to coexist and be referenced distinctly in drafts (with provenance/history visible)?
2) **Bar schema & relations:** Beyond the text and length-based expansions, what metadata should each Bar carry (e.g., tags/themes, usage examples, origin/provenance, related Bars, anti-Bars/contrasts, permissions)? And do you need typed relations like *supports/contradicts/refines/is-part-of* between Bars out of the gate?

## User
Alright, question one, when a bar evolves, do you want strict versioning? Well, so, okay, so, that's not, that's a good question to have, because I don't know that bars evolve. I, from what I gather, I don't believe they evolve. Bars are fixed. Bars are the basis vector. Bars are synthesized during organic dialogue. That's, that's where they come from. So, for example, I was vibing with Wendell last night, and we were kind of talking about ideas, and his book here, and philosophy, and all sorts of things, and at various points in time, Wendell paused and said, that's a bar. Oh, that's a bar, which is really fantastic. I personally really love this concept a whole, whole, whole, whole lot. My love for this concept is irrelevant in this particular thread. I just had to say it. So, beyond text and length-based expressions, what metadata should each bar carry? Yes, this is huge. The metadata is how we're going to index all of this information. Supports, contradicts, refines, yes. Typed relations, yes, are very important. So, tags and typed relations, that's how we're going to relate all of this. Because remember, well, not remember, but Wendell is a genius with a ton of information in his head, and currently in practice, a non-ergonomic and non-agentic way of trying to store all that information and riff on it. He uses ChatGPT a lot, the chatbot paradigm, which is extraordinarily helpful, but you and I both know that that has its limits. And so he's been trying to get this information from his brain into a usable form in text. And this tool that we're going to build is the mech suit that he needs to do that as efficiently and as effectively as possible.

## Assistant
Perfect—this helps a ton.

Here’s my updated understanding and how I’ll shape the system around it:

[...assistant’s full detailed spec...]

## User
This is all really good information, but don't generate this until I tell you to generate output for me so we can save some tokens. So I'm just going to take a look here. Global hotkey, yeah, the ergonomics, inline linking, relation sketching, latency targets. Yes, this stuff is all good. I'm wary about jumping into implementation at this stage. That's not the implementation. You'll be able to help with the implementation at any stage. So let's take a step back here and just pause a little bit. So let's see here. Inline linking, yes. I mean, relational sketching, yes. Yeah, okay. This is great. Let's back up. Let me give you kind of what I want from you. I want a zip file with various different things in it. So we're going to chat for a few minutes about what these downloadables are. And then at the end, then you can give me the zip file. So the first downloadable is, I want a markdown document of my understanding of what Window is trying to do. And along with that, I want you to synthesize a set of clarifying questions for Window to answer that corrects my understanding of what he's trying to do. So these are two different markdown files that we'll want. We'll want Nate's understanding. We'll want Window's understanding. Understanding of the project itself, not of the implementation of this tool, because this tool doesn't exist yet. So we want Nate's understanding of what Window is trying to do with this book, and kind of the core pieces that I've described to you. Because, yeah, it's very reductive. Bars is just one mechanic in a piece of this entire space. He's using a concept called integral theory, where there's this graph where the left axis is inside, the right is outside, the upper axis is one, and the bottom axis is many. And he has a higher development line than I do on this graph. He understands better. He's done more of this shadow work, this stuff that he's trying to teach. And so, yeah, Bars is not the thing. Bars is a part of the thing. The thing is to try to build a grammar of ontology, and what I want to do is build a set of tooling so that we can codify members of this grammar in a way that's easy to manipulate and retrieve all the ergonomics of doing that. So yeah, document one, Nate's understanding of what Window is trying to do. Document two, the first pass at clarifying questions for Window that corrects Nate's understanding. Three, I want a design plan, a pretty comprehensive design plan for this tool that we're trying to build. And part of that design plan, I want you to start out with the first pass at needs. It's like, what is needed to accomplish what's happening? And right now, you have Nate's understanding only. So this design document is going to be based on Nate's understanding, and we will correct that with Window's understanding. So other things that I want, I want prompts. So I want a prompt file that, I'm not sure yet. I'll need you to give me some suggestions for prompt files that'll be useful to have just lying around for this work that we're trying to do. I want a document of research summary. So at the beginning of this thread, I asked you to do a lot of research about what people are doing. So now after you know more about this, I want you to do that research again, and reread your past research, and distill what you find down into techniques that seem reasonable for this particular project. Now we don't need something extraordinarily complicated right off the bat. It needs to be easy and quick to build. We can just use someone else's patterns and architecture, most likely. So we can get this thing off the ground, so he can get this thing written. So yeah, we want that. Now we don't want any code yet, but what we do want is pseudocode. So in the design document, well, yeah, Window has his own agents that he wants as part of this. They are Amazon editors, I believe. So there's Sage, Diplomat. No, that's a different set of terms. Forget what I just said. Are you understanding so far? Don't give me any output yet. Just summarize what you think I'm asking of you.

## Assistant
Yes, I understand. Here’s my summary of what you’re asking for:  

[...assistant’s summary of deliverables...]

## User
Okay, this is a good start. What else do we want here? You know, based on your research, and as the design document, like, there's agentic architectures out there, where you have a set of agents working together to accomplish something. So, I want you to write a pseudocode document, also in Markdown, that describes the agents that will be needed for this project, and system prompts for those agents. And the system prompt for each of those agents will have information like, you know, you are, well, you know what system prompts are. You don't need me to describe this to you, actually. So that's kind of the final thing that I want, is a set of agents. And in the pseudocode, describe any tools that I need to build for these agents. And likely, I won't need to build them, if the description in the pseudocode is good enough, and if the prompts that you give me for Claude code, Claude sonnet, are good enough, then Claude will be able to do the implementation piecemeal, as I need it, from these core design documents. So, please take your time with everything. I'm ready for this zip file, but please take your time with everything. Take a lot of time. It's okay to sit and think here. Especially the document that describes the pseudocode for the agents that we're going to need, as part of this. Remember, I'm going to be using Pydantic AI, that is non-negotiable. And I probably don't even need a fancy framework, really. Like, I just need good agents. And the mechanics of what they're going to be doing, I will build over time. And it'll be simple at first, most likely. But what is really important is the system prompt for each of these agents. As well as pseudocode that describes the list of tools that each one of the agents will need. These are tools that I'll have to build, and I'll repeat myself here. With the description of those tools, and the right prompt for Cloud Sonnet, then I can go and construct them as needed, whenever I want. So I don't want any actual code here, as part of any of this output. So, yeah. Go ahead and sit and churn for a while, please. And give me this in a zip file.
