# Shadow OS

This package contains comprehensive planning documents for Wendell's "mech suit" cognitive amplification system.
Everything here is **textual** (Markdown) with **detailed pseudocode** — no implementation code, but ready for development.


## Contents
- `01_nate_understanding.md` — Enhanced understanding including the deeper context of shadow work, coaching methodology, and the "grammar of ontology" vision.
- `02_questions_for_wendell.md` — Expanded questions covering multi-modal capture, relationship dynamics, and configuration approaches.
- `03_design_plan.md` — Comprehensive design with enhanced config, sophisticated data models, and detailed operational flows.
- `04_research_summary.md` — RAG and agentic techniques specifically tailored for speed-of-thought cognitive amplification.
- `05_prompts_catalog.md` — Production-ready system prompts with detailed instructions for each agent, including new voice transcription and book generation capabilities.
- `06_agents_pseudocode_and_prompts.md` — Complete agent specifications with enhanced tools, sophisticated pseudocode, and conversation-informed system prompts.

## Key Architectural Insights from Conversation
- **Pydantic AI** as the mandated agent framework
- **YAML configuration** so Wendell can "tweak the knobs" without code changes
- **VS Code + Copilot/MCP** integration for development acceleration
- **Contradiction embrace** as a feature, not a bug
- **Citation integrity** as intellectual honesty enforcement

## The "Mech Suit" Vision
This system is designed to be **"the mech suit that Wendell needs to do [information extraction and composition] as efficiently and as effectively as possible."** It bridges:
- **Immediate insight capture** (the "that's a Bar" moment)
- **Structured knowledge building** (relationships, expansions, evidence)
- **On-demand book generation** (AI agents that can "produce a book at any moment's notice")

## Implementation Readiness
All prompts aim to be production-ready for Claude Sonnet. All pseudocode is detailed enough for direct translation to Pydantic AI agents. The configuration schemas are complete and ready for YAML implementation.

> Note: Bars are immutable atoms with memetic quality; expansions and relations are editable, versioned artifacts that preserve intellectual honesty through rigorous citation.tarter Package (v2025-08-26)

This package contains planning documents for Wendell’s authoring system.
Everything here is **textual** (Markdown) with **pseudocode only** — no real code.

> Note: Bars are immutable atoms; expansions and relations are editable, versioned artifacts.
> Config knobs are front-facing (YAML), so Wendell can tweak behavior without touching code.
