# Strategic Questions for Wendell (Framework & Workflow Focus) (v2025-08-26)

## Current AI Workflow & Friction Points
1. **Current ChatGPT usage**: What's working well in your current ChatGPT workflow? What specific outputs are you getting that you want to preserve?
2. **Friction analysis**: Where do you lose momentum or insights in your current process? What makes you want to abandon a conversation thread?
3. **Information leakage**: You mentioned "free-form chat leaks structure" - can you give specific examples of when this has cost you valuable insights?
4. **Context switching**: How often do you lose track of previous insights when starting new ChatGPT conversations? How do you currently try to maintain continuity?
5. **Output management**: What do you do with good ChatGPT outputs now? How do you find and reuse previous insights?
6. **Collaboration pain points**: When you want to share insights with others, what gets lost in translation from your head → ChatGPT → other person?

## The Mythopoetic Framework Vision
7. **Core transformation**: What specific transformation do you want readers to experience? How do they enter your book vs. how do they leave it?
8. **Teaching methodology**: When you say "teach people how to coach people to coach," what does that learning progression look like in practice?
9. **Shadow work integration**: How does shadow work specifically show up in your framework? What makes it essential rather than optional?
10. **Mythopoetic vs. clinical**: What's the right balance between evocative/archetypal language and precise/actionable guidance?
11. **Framework universality**: Is this framework meant to work across cultures, or is it specifically designed for certain contexts/populations?

## Content Creation & Organization
12. **Existing material**: What existing writings, notes, or recorded conversations could seed this system? How much raw material do you already have?
13. **Content types**: Beyond the core concepts (like Bars), what other types of content matter? (Stories, exercises, case studies, dialogues, etc.)
14. **Interconnection patterns**: How do your ideas typically connect? Do they build hierarchically, dialectically, or through other patterns?
15. **Contradictions as features**: Can you give examples of productive contradictions in your thinking? How do you want these preserved rather than resolved?
16. **Development over time**: How has your thinking evolved? Do you want to preserve that developmental journey or just the current understanding?

## Book Creation Process
17. **Primary outcome**: Is the first deliverable one book, multiple books, or a living curriculum? What must the first book accomplish to be "successful"?
18. **Audience specificity**: Who is this for? (Self-practitioners, professional coaches, teams, academics?) How does audience affect voice and depth?
19. **Reader journey**: What's the ideal reading experience? Linear progression, non-linear exploration, or something else?
20. **Practical integration**: How do readers apply this framework? What does "success" look like for someone who engages with your work?
21. **Book structure preferences**: Do you think in chapters, modules, themes, or other organizational patterns?

## Speed-of-Thought Capture
22. **Insight emergence**: When and where do your best insights come to you? (Walking, conversation, reading, meditation?)
23. **Capture ritual**: What would your ideal "capture an insight" process look like? Voice, text, drawing, or other modalities?
24. **Context preservation**: When you have a breakthrough, how much surrounding context needs to be preserved for it to remain meaningful later?
25. **Latency tolerance**: How quickly does an insight need to be captured before you lose it or it changes?
26. **Processing preferences**: Do you prefer to expand on insights immediately, or capture quickly and develop later?

## Collaboration & Knowledge Sharing
27. **Teaching applications**: How would you use this system when actually coaching or teaching others?
28. **Collaborative development**: Do you envision others contributing to your framework, or is this primarily your individual knowledge base?
29. **Knowledge transfer**: How do you want others to cite, reference, or build upon your work?
30. **Version control**: As your thinking evolves, how do you want to handle previous versions of ideas?
31. **Access control**: Are there aspects of your framework that should remain private or be revealed gradually?

## Technical Comfort & Configuration
32. **YAML complexity**: How comfortable are you with editing configuration files? What level of technical detail is manageable vs. overwhelming?
33. **Interface preferences**: What devices/contexts do you want to use this system in? (Desktop, mobile, voice-only, etc.)
34. **Automation vs. control**: Where do you want the AI to act autonomously vs. always ask for your input?
35. **Error tolerance**: When the system makes mistakes, how do you want to correct them? What's your patience level for imperfection?
36. **Learning curve**: How much time are you willing to invest in learning a new system before it needs to start paying dividends?

## Quality & Authenticity
37. **Voice preservation**: What aspects of your thinking/writing style are non-negotiable to preserve?
38. **Depth vs. accessibility**: How do you balance sophistication of ideas with readability/applicability?
39. **Quality signals**: How do you know when a piece of content (concept, explanation, story) is "good enough" vs. needs more work?
40. **Authenticity markers**: What tells you that generated content truly reflects your thinking vs. generic AI output?
41. **Integration testing**: How would you test whether the framework actually works for readers/practitioners?

## Success Metrics & Iteration
42. **Definition of success**: What would make this system worth the investment? What outcomes would justify the effort?
43. **Minimum viable product**: What's the smallest version of this that would be genuinely useful to you?
44. **Iteration approach**: How do you prefer to improve systems - big changes or incremental refinements?
45. **Usage patterns**: How often would you realistically use this system? Daily, weekly, project-based?
46. **Long-term vision**: If this works perfectly, how does it change your creative and teaching practice in 2-3 years?

## Integration with Existing Practice
47. **Current tools**: What other tools/systems would this need to integrate with or replace in your workflow?
48. **Habit integration**: How does this fit into your existing creative and professional routines?
49. **Backup concerns**: How important is it that your knowledge base be portable/exportable?
50. **Evolution readiness**: As AI capabilities improve, how do you want this system to evolve with new possibilities?
